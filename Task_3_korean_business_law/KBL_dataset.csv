What are the characteristics of Yongo ties?,"Yongo ties are immutable and irreversible, pre-defined by birth, and cannot be chosen (with the exception of an alma mater). They are maintained for life, homogeneous, closed, and exclusive. Bridging between different Yongo networks is very unusual, but bridging within a particular Yongo network works well."
Can foreigners easily establish original Yongo?,"No, foreigners, such as expatriates, cannot easily establish original Yongo, since they have no genuine Korean ties."
How are different Yongo networks often reported to be towards each other?,"Different Yongo networks can be, and are often reported as being in competition with or hostile towards each other."
What is the purpose of Yonjul relationships?,"Yonjul relationships are a ""mutual patron-client network with a strong paternalistic tone."""
What is the meaning of Yongo in Korean culture?,"Yongo in Korean culture refers to a conventional social relationship that is partly preset, immutable, cause-based, homogeneous, and exclusive. It is a network society where every Korean is a member, and these networks are often hostile towards each other and in competition. Yongo relationships are lifelong and can be used for various purposes such as job acquisition, career progression, information gathering, and government relations."
What is the difference between Yongo and Yonjul in Korean culture?,"While both Yongo and Yonjul refer to relationships or connections in Korean culture, they have different connotations. Yongo is a value-neutral term that refers to a conventional social relationship, while Yonjul has a negative connotation. Yonjul relationships are often established for personal benefit in situations where there should be fair competition or equality. They are associated with unethical behavior such as under-the-table transactions, cronyism, bribery, corruption, and so on."
How has the understanding of national cultures evolved over time?,"The conventional approach of classifying cultures into static categories has been criticized as no longer sufficient for explaining national cultures in a satisfactory way. This is because it treats national cultures as static constructs, which does not account for the dynamic changes that countries experience over time. There is a need for a reevaluation of national cultures and the inclusion of a dynamic view of culture."
How has the Korean economy and society changed in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis?,"The Korean economy and society experienced drastic changes in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of 1997/98 and the restructuring measures directed by the IMF.

What is the main argument of Chang's (2006) study on individual pay-for-performance systems in Korea?,"Chang's study examines the effect of individual pay-for-performance systems on employee attitudes toward organizational commitment in Korea. The study challenges the assumption that rewarding individual performance in a collectivistic culture like Korea would cause tension due to the violation of social group norms. Surprisingly, Chang's research does not confirm a negative effect on organizational commitment, suggesting that the general assumption that Korea is purely collectivistic may be incorrect, and both norms of collectivism and individualism prevail in the country."
What is the main argument of the passage regarding the cultural environment in Korea?,"The passage suggests that Koreans can exhibit both individualistic and collectivistic behaviors depending on the situational context, with the relational context being more important than the overall societal configuration. The behavior of Koreans is largely determined by affective ties embedded in a Confucian value frame, such as Yongo and Inmaek relationships. These affective ties can be considered an important contextual dimension or life space. The passage proposes that collectivism in Korea depends on the context, and if affective ties exist, Koreans act as contextuals; if not, they act in more individualistic ways."
What are the different types of ties in Korea and their implications for business purposes?,"In Korea, there are three types of ties: Yongo, Inmaek, and Yonjul. Yonjul is typically instrumental by nature and serves a purpose, but it has a negative connotation and is often associated with selfish actions and ""under the table"" activities, such as bribery, cronyism, or corruption. Yongo, on the other hand, is preset and not instrumental by nature, but it can become instrumental, especially in business and politics. It binds people and provides ad hoc prescriptions of trust that can be developed further if desired by the parties involved. Inmaek is a tie based on shared experiences and mutual understanding, which can be more meaningful and long-lasting than Yongo or Yonjul ties. All three ties can be useful and exploitable for business purposes, but the nature and ethics of the tie depend on how it is used and the intentions of the parties involved."
What is the assessment of the ethicality of Yongo and Inmaek in the context of Korean social networks?,"The ethical assessment of Yongo and Inmaek depends on the point of view. Yongo, by its very nature, can be regarded as very ethical if it is not purpose-based and not used instrumentally. However, if it turns into Yonjul actions, it is not very ethical. Inmaek, on the other hand, is potentially purpose-based and instrumental, but it is not cause-based like Yongo. Since networking is generally not considered unethical, engaging in Inmaek can be regarded as ethical under normal circumstances."
In what ways can expatriate managers navigate the challenges posed by Yongo networks in Korea?,"Expatriate managers can navigate the challenges posed by Yongo networks in Korea by finding ways to prevent Yongo-based information transfer, organizing teams considering personal background heterogeneity to prevent Yongo fragmentation, and hiring local managers with high Yongo endowment who can take advantage of existing Yongo ties."
What is the main argument of the chapter regarding the network view of the Korean society and business environment?,The main argument of the chapter is that the network view of the Korean society and business environment can supersede the low-trust and collectivist society paradigm and bring new phenomena to the surface that advance the current knowledge on Korea's cultural environment.
